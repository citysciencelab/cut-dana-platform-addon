The Data Narrator (DANA) is a **[Masterportal](https://www.masterportal.org/)** add-on that can be used to add text,
photos and images to geo-referenced data sets.
In this way, the usually very technical and purely data-based representations can be supplemented with information and
more descriptive representations.
The data shown is contextualized and complex relationships become easier to understand.
Users click their way through a story step by step.

To test DANA with an example story go to the GitHub page of
the **[City Science Lab ](https://github.com/citysciencelab/cut-data-narrator)**
The aforementioned repository includes an example from the real-life experiment 'Mobilities of care'. Topics such as the
mobility behavior of unpaid care workers can thus be communicated and located more easily. This is available under the
portal configuration called '/mobility-data/'.
The example portal configuration is included in this repository in the example folder. A running portal configuration
that includes 3D data can be
found **[here](https://github.com/citysciencelab/cut-data-narrator/tree/dev/portal/3d-test)**

**Example**

```json
"dataNarrator": {
"name": "Data Narrator",
"glyphicon": "glyphicon-book"
}
```

## Explore your story

After creating your story in the creator section of the Data Narrator, you can download the story as zip file.
The zip file contains a `story.json` and, in case you added HTML content to your story, a `story` folder.

**Example**

story.zip content folder structure

```
story.zip
|-- story.json
|-- story
|    step_1-1.html
|    step_2-1.html
|    step_2-2.html
|   |-- images
|   |   |-- step_1-1_1.png
|   |   |-- step_1-1_2.jpg
```

To explore your story in the Data Narrator ...

1. place the content of the zip file in your portal config folder
2. add a `storyConf` parameter to the `Config` in your portal's `config.js` with the path to the `story.json` as value

**Example**

portal folder structure

```
masterportal/portal
|-- my_portal
|    config.js
|    config.json
|    index.html
|   |-- story.json
|   |-- story
|   |    step_1-1.html
|   |    step_2-1.html
|   |    step_2-2.html
|   |   |-- images
|   |   |   |-- step_1-1_1.png
|   |   |   |-- step_1-1_2.jpg
```

config.js

```js
const Config = {
    addons: ["dataNarrator"],
    storyConf: "./story.json",
    [...
]
}
;
```
